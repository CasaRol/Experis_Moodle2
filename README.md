The application here is a simple fil manipulator which takes an argument as to which file to look at 
and then outputs one of the selectable functions: 
* List all files ready for manipulation
* List hos many lines a certain file consist of
* List the size of a given file
* Look for a certain word within a file
* Look up how many times a certain word appears within a given file

### How This project is made

This project has been made using Visual Studio Code in order to learn how a normal IDE (Integraded Development Environment) handles files and folders/packages.  
This means that every single project file has been manually compilled using the terminal/CMD for the exstra learning experience as to how to create an executable JAR-file.  

### How to manually create a JAR-file

First is to open the terminal and go to your root of your project.  
Then you want to compile every single java-file in the project using only one command like shown below.  
Make sure to also specify a folder for where to put the compiled files like here where I specify /out to be the endpoint.
